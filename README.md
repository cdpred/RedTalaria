# RedTalaria URLs for Unreal Engine

RedTalaria is a plugin for Unreal Engine that builds on [Hermes](https://github.com/jorgenpt/Hermes) and provides a collection of Hermes endpoints to link "parts" of your project and share them with your team e.g. through Slack.

Big thanks to [Jørgen P. Tjernø](https://github.com/jorgenpt) for [Hermes](https://github.com/jorgenpt/Hermes)!

# Engine compatibilty

RedTalaria was tested (and thus should be compatible) with UE 5.1 and UE 4.27.

# Setup

1. Setup [Hermes](https://github.com/jorgenpt/Hermes#setup).
2. Clone this repository into your project's Plugins folder.
3. Start your editor and enjoy your new Hermes endpoints.

# Using

## Linking Blueprint nodes
Once you've set up RedTalaria, you should be able to right click on any Blueprint node and see a new `Copy 'Focus node' URL` option:

[<img src="README_link_blueprint_node_focus.png?raw=true">](README_link_blueprint_node_focus.png?raw=true)

Clicking on links like these will open up the asset in the editor and focus on the linked node.

---

For nodes that have a jump target, you'll see an additional `Copy 'Open node' URL` option:

[<img src="README_link_blueprint_node_jump_target.png?raw=true">](README_link_blueprint_node_jump_target.png?raw=true)

Clicking on links like these will open up the (jump target of the) linked node in the editor.

## Linking BehaviorTree nodes
This feature is only available in UE 5.3+, if you are using a source build, make sure you have [this commit](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/commit/6bb52ead8294554e5bdb60f637729eae397942d8).

Once you've set up RedTalaria, you should be able to right click on any BehaviorTree node and see a new `Copy 'Focus node' URL` option:

[<img src="README_link_behavior_tree_node_focus.png?raw=true">](README_link_behavior_tree_node_focus.png?raw=true)

Clicking on links like these will open up the asset in the editor and focus on the linked node.

## Linking Levels at a specific camera position
Once you've set up RedTalaria, under the Viewport options menu you should see a new `Copy camera coords URL` option (it will only be active for perspective viewports):

[<img src="README_link_level_at_camera_coords.png?raw=true">](README_link_level_at_camera_coords.png?raw=true)

Clicking on links like these will open up the level at the exact camera location / rotation for when the link was made.

## Linking folders in the content browser

Once you've set up RedTalaria, when right clicking on a folder in the content browser you should see a new `Copy folder URL` option:

[<img src="README_link_content_folder_1.png?raw=true">](README_link_content_folder_1.png?raw=true)
[<img src="README_link_content_folder_2.png?raw=true">](README_link_content_folder_2.png?raw=true)

Clicking on links like these will focus the given folder in the content browser.

# Extending

## Creating custom URLs for graph nodes
Take a look at [RedHermesGraphNodeEndpoint](Source/RedHermesGraphNodeEndpoint/Public/RedHermesGraphNodeEndpoint.h) & [RedHermesGraphNodeEndpointEditorExtension](Source/RedHermesGraphNodeEndpoint/Public/RedHermesGraphNodeEndpointEditorExtension.h), which serve as a base for linking graph nodes, and
[RedHermesBlueprintNodeEndpoint](Source/RedHermesBlueprintNodeEndpoint/Public/RedHermesBlueprintNodeEndpoint.h) as a concrete example building on them.

## Creating custom URLs with your own functionality
Take a look at [RedHermesEndpoint](Source/RedTalaria/Public/RedHermesEndpoint.h), which serves as a base for custom Hermes endpoints, and [RedHermesLevelAtCameraCoordsEndpoint](Source/RedHermesLevelAtCameraCoordsEndpoint/Public/RedHermesLevelAtCameraCoordsEndpoint.h) & [RedHermesLevelAtCameraCoordsEndpointEditorExtension](Source/RedHermesLevelAtCameraCoordsEndpoint/Public/RedHermesLevelAtCameraCoordsEndpointEditorExtension.h) as a concrete example building on it.
